# Sampling methods III
Contains : 
 - Metropolis Hastings (lambda should be chosen such that lambda is not too close to 0 or inf)

# TODO : 
 - needs extensive testing :
	- pt1. seems to work (choice of lambda ?)
	- pt2. very weird behaviour 
	- pt3. bug
 - methods2 : seems like both coordinates are the same
